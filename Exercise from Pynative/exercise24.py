# Practice Problem: Write a program to print the first 15 terms of the
# Fibonacci series. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent
# number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
#
# Exercise Purpose: The Fibonacci sequence is a classic way to learn about state
# management in loops. You keep track of two changing variables at once to find
# the next number, which helps you see how data moves through each step.
#
# Given Input: Terms = 15
#
# Expected Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377

Terms = int(input("Enter number of Terms: "))

FirstTerm = 0
print(FirstTerm, end="  ")
SecondTerm = 1
print(SecondTerm, end="  ")

for x in range(Terms - 2):
    Sum = FirstTerm + SecondTerm
    FirstTerm = SecondTerm
    SecondTerm = Sum
    print(Sum, end="  ")
