# Create Higher-Order Function
# Write a function apply_operation(func, x, y)
# that takes a function func and two numbers x and y as arguments,
# and returns the result of calling func(x, y).
# Demonstrate its use with different functions (e.g., addition, subtraction).
#
# The exercise requires you to create a higher-order function,
# which is a function that can take other functions as arguments.

def mul(x, y):
    return x * y

def div(x, y):
    return x / y

def apply_operation(func, x, y):
    return func(x, y)

print(apply_operation(mul, 2, 3))
print(apply_operation(div, 9, 3))
